## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: The design should evoke trust, curiosity, and empowerment. Users should feel confident in the educational quality and supported in their learning journey.

**Design Personality**: Professional yet approachable, clean and modern, accessibility-focused. The design feels like a trusted educational institution meets cutting-edge technology.

**Visual Metaphors**: Light and growth (learning), building blocks (knowledge construction), bridges (accessibility), shields (trust/verification).

**Simplicity Spectrum**: Clean minimal interface that doesn't overwhelm, but rich enough to provide comprehensive educational feedback and guidance.

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Analogous with educational blue-orange accent
**Primary Color**: Deep Educational Blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 240)) - conveys trust, knowledge, stability
**Secondary Colors**: Light Academic Gray (oklch(0.95 0.02 240)) - provides calm, readable backgrounds
**Accent Color**: Warm Learning Orange (oklch(0.65 0.15 45)) - energizing, highlighting important actions
**Color Psychology**: Blue builds trust and focus, orange adds warmth and engagement, gray provides calm foundation
**Color Accessibility**: All pairings meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 contrast minimum)
**Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
- Background (near-white) + Foreground (deep blue-gray): Maximum readability
- Primary (deep blue) + Primary-foreground (white): Strong action indicators  
- Accent (orange) + Accent-foreground (white): Clear CTAs
- Card (white) + Card-foreground (deep blue-gray): Clean content areas

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with varied weights for consistency and accessibility
**Typographic Hierarchy**: 
- Headlines: Inter 700 (bold) for clear structure
- Body: Inter 400 (regular) for optimal readability
- UI elements: Inter 500 (medium) for interactive clarity
**Font Personality**: Inter conveys professionalism, modernity, and excellent cross-platform readability
**Readability Focus**: 1.6 line height, generous spacing, scalable text for accessibility modes
**Typography Consistency**: Consistent use of Inter family across all elements
**Which fonts**: Inter (single font family from Google Fonts)
**Legibility Check**: Inter is specifically designed for screen readability and supports extensive Unicode characters

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Progressive disclosure - content upload → processing → quiz interaction → results review
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing creates calm, focused learning environment
**Grid System**: Container-based responsive layout with consistent spacing units
**Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first design that scales up gracefully
**Content Density**: Balanced - enough information to be useful without overwhelming

### Animations
**Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle animations guide users through multi-step processes (content processing, quiz progression)
**Hierarchy of Movement**: Processing indicators have priority, followed by state transitions, then micro-interactions
**Contextual Appropriateness**: Gentle, purposeful motion that supports learning without distraction

### UI Elements & Component Selection
**Component Usage**: 
- Cards for content organization and quiz questions
- Progress bars for processing and quiz progression  
- Badges for status indicators and difficulty levels

**Screen Reader Support**: Proper semantic HTML, ARIA labels, descriptive alt text
**Motor Accessibility**: Minimum 44px touch targets, generous spacing
**Cognitive Accessibility**: Clear language, consistent navigation, reduced cognitive load

## Implementation Considerations

**Scalability Needs**: Component-based architecture allows for easy feature additions and content type expansions
**Testing Focus**: AI response quality, accessibility compliance, cross-platform compatibility
**Critical Questions**: How to ensure AI-generated content quality? How to handle edge cases in content processing?
